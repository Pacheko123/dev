Hello! I'm Pacheko, from Kisumu, Kenya.

A Computer Science student at [Multimedia University of Kenya](https://www.mmu.ac.ke/), Kenya.

<!-- I have completed my Bachelors from [BIT Mesra](https://www.bitmesra.ac.in/) in Computer Science and Engineering (2016-2020) with [86.3% aggregate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G4UBPBP0mvWZLRdkF_EcpmKKGp7_OA8U/view?usp=sharing).  -->

<!-- I have also been awarded as Runners-Up in [Project ICE(Innovative and Creative Environment) Fair](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1laynNsd9hIqxL-imT8dkAWqq7ZO4hj1a/view?usp=sharing) by Amdocs. -->
